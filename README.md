# DSA playground

This is just a repo for playing around with various data structure/algorithm topics. I'll probably mainly use this to aid my understanding of topics I'm not comfortable with, by writing my own implementations, with no intention of completeness or efficiency.

As I mainly use this repo for self-study of various CS problems, I'll often refer to the literature I'm following. Often, this will be _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, (CLRS for short).
